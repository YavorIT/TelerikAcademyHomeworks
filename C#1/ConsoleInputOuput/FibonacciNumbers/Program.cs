						Problem 10. Fibonacci Numbers

	Write a program that reads a number n and prints on the 
	console the first n members of the Fibonacci sequence 
	(at a single line, separated by comma and space -,): 
	0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, â€¦.

	Note: You may need to learn how to use loops.
